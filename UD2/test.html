    <p>True flight is shared only by insects, bats, and birds. Examples of other animals 
        that are capable of soaring are flying fish, flying squirrels, flying frogs, and 
        flying snakes. The capacity for flight in insects is believed to have developed 
        some 300 million years ago, and initially consisted of simple extensions of the cuticle 
        from the thorax. The success of insects during development of flight was due to their
        small size. Of course, not all insects have developed wings, these including such groups 
        as spring-tails and silverfish. Some parasitic groups are believed to have lost their wings 
        through evolution. When wings are present in insects, they commonly consist of two pairs. 
        These include grasshoppers, bees, wasps, dragonflies, true bugs, butterflies, moths and others. 
        The outer pair of wings of beetles commonly are quite hard and not functional in flight. 
        The ability to fly is not determined by the number or size of wings. Some insects with large wings, 
        such as Dobsonflies and Antlions, are relatively poor fliers, while bees and wasps with smaller wings are good fliers. 
        True flies are a large group of insects with only one pair of wings, although they have small balancing organs
        known as halteres where a second pair of wings might develop. The halteres vibrate with the wings and sense changes of direction.
